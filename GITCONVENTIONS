The general strategy for development in this repo will be for work to be
integrated in the dev branch and merged to the master branch whenever a
fresh deployment is to be done.

Work will take place in topic branches. These will be squash merged into
dev when ready. The topic branches will remain on github so that the
squash merge does not lose details of history.

Topic branches may have branches based off of them. They may be merged
into their topic branch with or without squashing. A subbranch of a
topic branch may rewrite its own history. (As in, work on a subbranch
may be rebased even if that subbranch has been pushed to git already and
thus might require --force for a subsequent git push of that subbranch.)
Consequently, no one should ever base work off of a subbranch or merge
from it.

These all are guidelines, not rules, and can be amended as the
developing workflow requires. Such amendments *should* be reflected in
this file, but there is some prospect of drift.
